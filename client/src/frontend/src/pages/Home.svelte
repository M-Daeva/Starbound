      Hey there fellow degens! Welcome to Starbound, the ultimate portfolio
      management app for the Cosmos ecosystem making possible to buy and
      delegate assets using the <a

        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp"
        >Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy</a
      >. I know you're tired of all the scam, shitcoins, and volatility in the
      crypto market, but don't worry, Starbound has got you covered!

      First things first, connect your wallet so we can get started. Once you're
      connected, your wallet address will show up on the app. Now it's time to
      set your portfolio parameters. Head to the Portfolio tab, select your
      asset, set its weight, and sort by whatever criteria you like. If you're
      feeling lazy, you can also enable auto delegation by selecting your
      validator and clicking that sweet grant button. But don't worry, you can
      always disable it later.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Now, let's make some deposits! On the Bank tab, choose your rebalancing
      option (by default the app doesn't provide portfolio rebalancing and just
      converts your stablecoins to assets according to weights), specify your
      payment in stablecoins, and set your investment period. Then, click that
      deposit button and sit back while the app does the rest. It'll swap and
      delegate your funds like a pro ðŸ˜Ž.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Check out your dashboard to see your portfolio's net worth and asset
      allocation. Please note that you can only see the assets stored in contact
      via the deposit button. If you want to make any changes, go ahead and do
      it! Change your portfolio parameters, validator selection, and rebalancing
      options whenever you like. You can even add or remove funds from your
      deposit.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      So there you have it, folks. Starbound is the easy, efficient, and fun way
      to manage your portfolio and automate your investments using the DCA
      strategy. Start investing like a pro today!
